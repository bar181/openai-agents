# Tutorials Folder Overview

Welcome to the Tutorials directory for the AI Agents course. This directory is structured to provide detailed, step-by-step guidance and comprehensive documentation for each module. Every module folder contains specific resources to help you build, test, and refine your AI agents efficiently.

## Directory Structure

Each module within the Tutorials directory follows a consistent structure:

```plaintext
tutorials/
├── module1/
│   ├── tutorial.md                 # Detailed, step-by-step tutorial
│   ├── README.md                   # Overview and setup instructions
│   ├── implementation_plan.md      # High-level project strategy and roadmap
│   ├── implementation_process.md   # Checklist of implementation steps
│   ├── phase1.md                   # Specific implementation details for Phase 1
│   └── ...                         # Additional phase or guideline documents
├── module2/
│   └── ... (same structure)
├── module3/
│   └── ... (same structure)
├── module4/
│   └── ... (same structure)
└── ...                             # Subsequent modules follow the same pattern
```

## Documents Included in Each Module

- **tutorial.md:** 
  - Provides detailed explanations, step-by-step instructions, code examples, and tips.
  - Ideal for understanding how to practically implement module objectives.

- **README.md:**
  - Quick-start guide containing module overview, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines.

- **implementation_plan.md:**
  - High-level outline of the module's objectives and development roadmap.

- **implementation_process.md:**
  - Checklist to track your progress and ensure all requirements are met.

- **phaseX.md (e.g., phase1.md, phase2.md):**
  - Detailed breakdowns of implementation phases with explicit instructions, code samples, and best practices.

- **guidelines.md (if applicable):**
  - Coding standards, testing methodologies, and recommended practices for maintaining quality and consistency.

## How to Use These Resources

- Start each module by reviewing its `README.md` for a general overview and initial setup.
- Move on to `tutorial.md` to follow along with detailed instructions.
- Regularly reference `implementation_plan.md` and `implementation_process.md` to stay aligned with project goals.
- Consult phase-specific documentation (`phaseX.md`) for detailed, incremental guidance as you build out each part of the module.
- Use `guidelines.md` as a reference for maintaining coding and testing standards.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Initial Setup:** Follow the README instructions.
2. **Detailed Learning:** Use `tutorial.md` to gain comprehensive knowledge.
3. **Incremental Implementation:** Complete tasks using phase documents (`phase1.md`, etc.).
4. **Validation and Review:** Regularly check against the implementation checklist.
5. **Quality Assurance:** Adhere to provided guidelines to ensure code quality and consistency.

Happy coding, and enjoy building your AI agent skills!
