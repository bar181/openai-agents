## Checklist of Activities

1. **Reorganize Agents Directory**
   - [✔] **Created Subfolder:**  
     - New folder `app/agents/story/` was created to house all story-related agents.
   - [✔] **Moved and Renamed Baseline Agent:**  
     - Moved `app/agents/story_telling_agent.py` (from Module 1) into `app/agents/story/` and renamed it to `baseline_story_agent.py`.

2. **Implement Custom Story Agent**
   - [✔] **New File:**  
     - Created `app/agents/story/custom_story_agent.py` with enhanced narrative logic.
   - [✔] **Agent Functionality:**  
     - Implemented a new function tool `generate_custom_outline` to produce a creative and detailed story outline.
     - Instantiated the custom story agent (`custom_story_agent`) with enhanced instructions.
     - Developed the asynchronous runner function `run_custom_story_agent`.

3. **Update API Router**
   - [✔] **Router Consolidation:**  
     - Updated the router file to `app/routers/story_router.py` to include endpoints for baseline, custom, and (in Phase 3) advanced story agents.
   - [✔] **Endpoint Updates:**  
     - Added `/baseline` endpoint for the baseline story agent.
     - Added `/custom` endpoint for the custom story agent.
     - **Phase 3:** Added `/advanced` endpoint for the advanced story agent.
     - Enhanced Swagger documentation for all endpoints.

4. **Update Main Application**
   - [✔] **Router Inclusion:**  
     - Verified that `app/main.py` correctly includes the updated `story_router.py` with the appropriate prefix (`/agents/story`).

5. **Implement Advanced Story Agent (Phase 3)**
   - [✔] **New File:**  
     - Created `app/agents/story/advanced_story_agent.py` implementing a multi-step workflow for generating a complete narrative.
   - [✔] **Agent Functionality:**  
     - Defined structured output using Pydantic models.
     - Implemented function tools `generate_advanced_outline` and `generate_advanced_story_body`.
     - Instantiated the advanced story agent (`advanced_story_agent`) with detailed instructions.
     - Developed the asynchronous runner function `run_advanced_story_agent`.

6. **Update Tests**
   - [✔] **Test File Adjustments:**  
     - Modified `tests/test_mod2_story.py` to reflect the new endpoint paths (`/agents/story/baseline`, `/agents/story/custom`, and `/agents/story/advanced`).
   - [✔] **Verification:**  
     - Ran tests with `python -m pytest tests/` and confirmed that all tests pass.
