# Phase 1: Agent Lifecycle and Dynamic System Prompt

## Objective

In Phase 1, we implement and demonstrate agent lifecycle management and dynamic system prompt functionalities within our FastAPI application. This phase includes initializing agents, dynamically adjusting system prompts based on user input, integrating these features with FastAPI endpoints, ensuring their correctness through testing, and updating the documentation.

## Steps

### Step 1: Implement Agent Lifecycle Management

**Description:**

Develop a comprehensive lifecycle agent showcasing initialization, execution, and termination processes, including error handling and state management.

**Completed Actions:**
- Implemented `LifecycleAgent` class with structured methods for initialization, execution, and termination.
- Included state tracking to monitor agent status.
- Implemented convenience functions for direct integration with API endpoints.

**File:** `app/agents/basic/lifecycle_agent.py`

### Step 2: Develop Dynamic System Prompt Functionality

**Description:**

Create an agent that dynamically adjusts its system prompt to alter its behavior based on context or user input.

**Completed Actions:**
- Implemented `DynamicPromptAgent` class with methods to update and apply dynamic prompts.
- Provided clear internal state management to ensure consistency in agent responses.

**File:** `app/agents/basic/dynamic_prompt_agent.py`

### Step 3: Integrate with FastAPI

**Description:**

Expose lifecycle and dynamic prompt functionalities through structured FastAPI endpoints under logical path prefixes.

**Completed Actions:**
- Defined endpoints with descriptive routes for agent lifecycle and dynamic prompt functionality.
- Created and utilized Pydantic models for input and response validation.
- Integrated endpoints into the FastAPI app with consistent prefixing.

**Files:**
- `app/routers/basic_agents.py`
- `app/main.py`

**Endpoint Structure:**

- **Lifecycle Management:**
  - `POST /agents/basic/lifecycle/initialize`
  - `POST /agents/basic/lifecycle/execute`
  - `POST /agents/basic/lifecycle/terminate`

- **Dynamic Prompt:**
  - `POST /agents/basic/dynamic-prompt/update`
  - `POST /agents/basic/dynamic-prompt/execute`

### Step 4: Testing

**Description:**

Ensure agent functionalities are correctly implemented and exposed by creating robust integration tests.

**Completed Actions:**
- Developed integration tests covering all implemented endpoints.
- Verified successful endpoint responses, data integrity, and proper agent state management.
- Confirmed all tests pass successfully using pytest.

**File:** `tests/test_basic_agents.py`

**Test Execution:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_basic_agents.py
```

### Step 5: Documentation Update

**Description:**

Document clearly the new functionalities, including API endpoints, use cases, and examples. Ensure documentation is reflected in the auto-generated Swagger UI.

**Completed Actions:**
- Updated detailed Swagger descriptions for all endpoints.
- Provided practical examples for each API interaction.
- Ensured documentation consistency and clarity for users accessing via Swagger UI.

**Accessible Documentation:**
- Swagger UI at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Detailed descriptions embedded within FastAPI endpoint implementations.

## Summary

Phase 1 is successfully completed with robust agent lifecycle management, dynamic prompt handling, integrated API endpoints, comprehensive tests, and updated documentation. The groundwork laid in this phase provides a solid foundation for further module development and expansion.
