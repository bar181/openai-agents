To effectively implement Module 3: Basic OpenAI Agents, we'll build upon the foundation established in Module 2. This module introduces various basic agent functionalities, including streaming responses and agent lifecycle management.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Set Up Module 3 Directory:**
   - Create the `module3-basic-agents` directory following the structure outlined above.

2. **Develop Basic Agents:**
   - **Agent Lifecycle Example (`agent_lifecycle_example.py`):**
     - Demonstrates the management of an agent's lifecycle, including initialization, execution, and termination.
     - **Pseudocode:**
       ```python
       Initialize agent with specific parameters
       Start agent execution
       Monitor agent status
       Handle agent termination
       ```
   - **Dynamic System Prompt (`dynamic_system_prompt.py`):**
     - Illustrates how to dynamically adjust the system prompt based on context or user input.
     - **Pseudocode:**
       ```python
       Define function to generate dynamic prompt
       Update agent's system prompt during runtime
       Process user input with updated prompt
       ```
   - **Stream Items (`stream_items.py`):**
     - Shows how to stream a sequence of items (e.g., jokes, facts) to the user in real-time.
     - **Pseudocode:**
       ```python
       Define function to generate items
       Stream items to user with delays
       ```
   - **Stream Text (`stream_text.py`):**
     - Demonstrates streaming text responses to the user as they are generated.
     - **Pseudocode:**
       ```python
       Generate text response incrementally
       Stream text to user in real-time
       ```
   - **Tools (`tools.py`):**
     - Contains definitions of tools that agents can utilize, such as functions for fetching weather data or performing calculations.
     - **Pseudocode:**
       ```python
       Define tool functions
       Register tools with agents
       ```

3. **Integrate Agents with FastAPI:**
   - Create `basic_router.py` to define API endpoints for each agent, allowing users to interact with them via HTTP requests.
   - Update `main.py` to include the new router.

4. **Manage Configuration and Dependencies:**
   - Ensure `config.py` and `dependencies.py` are updated to handle any new environment variables or dependencies introduced in this module.

5. **Develop Documentation:**
   - Write `phase1.md` and `phase2.md` to detail the implementation steps and any enhancements made during the development of Module 3.
   - Maintain `implementation_process.md` as a checklist to track completed activities.

6. **Implement Testing:**
   - Create test files for each agent to ensure they function as expected.
   - Utilize testing frameworks like `pytest` to automate testing processes.

7. **Update README:**
   - Provide an overview of Module 3, including instructions on how to set up and run the agents.

By following this plan, you'll effectively implement Module 3, introducing basic OpenAI agent functionalities and integrating them into your FastAPI application.
