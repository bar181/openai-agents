# Phase 1: Agent Lifecycle and Dynamic System Prompt

## Objective

In this phase, we aim to implement and demonstrate the agent lifecycle management and dynamic system prompt functionalities within our FastAPI application. This includes initializing agents, dynamically adjusting system prompts based on user input, integrating these features with FastAPI endpoints, and ensuring their correctness through testing.

## Steps

### Step 1: Implement Agent Lifecycle Management

**Description:**

Develop the agent lifecycle example to showcase the initialization, execution, and termination processes of an agent. This involves creating an agent that can manage its own lifecycle events, providing insights into how agents can be controlled and monitored throughout their operation.

**Actions:**

- Create a new agent class that includes methods for initialization, execution, and termination.
- Implement logging within each lifecycle method to track the agent's state transitions.
- Ensure the agent can handle exceptions gracefully during its lifecycle.

**Pseudocode:**


```python
class LifecycleAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize agent resources
        pass

    def execute(self, input_data):
        # Process input_data and perform agent tasks
        pass

    def terminate(self):
        # Clean up resources and terminate agent
        pass
```


### Step 2: Develop Dynamic System Prompt Functionality

**Description:**

Create functionality that allows the system prompt of an agent to be adjusted dynamically based on context or user input. This enables the agent to modify its behavior in response to changing requirements or environments.

**Actions:**

- Implement a method within the agent class to update the system prompt.
- Ensure the agent can retrieve and apply the updated prompt during execution.
- Validate that the dynamic prompt influences the agent's responses appropriately.

**Pseudocode:**


```python
class DynamicPromptAgent:
    def __init__(self, initial_prompt):
        self.system_prompt = initial_prompt

    def update_prompt(self, new_prompt):
        self.system_prompt = new_prompt

    def execute(self, input_data):
        # Use self.system_prompt to guide processing of input_data
        pass
```


### Step 3: Integrate with FastAPI

**Description:**

Expose the agent lifecycle and dynamic prompt functionalities through FastAPI endpoints, allowing external clients to interact with these features via HTTP requests.

**Actions:**

- Define FastAPI routes for initializing, executing, and terminating the agent.
- Create endpoints to update the system prompt dynamically.
- Utilize Pydantic models for request and response schemas to ensure data validation and automatic documentation.

**Pseudocode:**


```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class PromptUpdate(BaseModel):
    new_prompt: str

@app.post("/agent/initialize")
async def initialize_agent():
    # Initialize agent
    pass

@app.post("/agent/execute")
async def execute_agent(input_data: dict):
    # Execute agent with input_data
    pass

@app.post("/agent/terminate")
async def terminate_agent():
    # Terminate agent
    pass

@app.post("/agent/update-prompt")
async def update_agent_prompt(prompt_update: PromptUpdate):
    # Update agent's system prompt
    pass
```


### Step 4: Testing

**Description:**

Write and execute tests to ensure that both the agent lifecycle management and dynamic system prompt functionalities operate as expected. This includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the FastAPI endpoints.

**Actions:**

- Develop unit tests for the agent's lifecycle methods and dynamic prompt updates.
- Create integration tests for the FastAPI endpoints using FastAPI's TestClient.
- Verify that the agent behaves correctly under various scenarios, including edge cases.

**Pseudocode:**


```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_initialize_agent():
    response = client.post("/agent/initialize")
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_execute_agent():
    response = client.post("/agent/execute", json={"input_data": {...}})
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_update_agent_prompt():
    response = client.post("/agent/update-prompt", json={"new_prompt": "New prompt"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
```


### Step 5: Documentation Update

**Description:**

Update the project's documentation to reflect the newly implemented features, providing clear instructions on how to use the agent lifecycle management and dynamic system prompt functionalities.

**Actions:**

- Document the purpose and usage of each FastAPI endpoint.
- Include examples of how to interact with the agent through the API.
- Ensure the documentation is accessible via FastAPI's automatic Swagger UI and Redoc interfaces.

**Pseudocode:**


```markdown
# Agent Lifecycle and Dynamic System Prompt API

## Endpoints

### Initialize Agent

**POST** `/agent/initialize`

Initializes the agent.

### Execute Agent

**POST** `/agent/execute`

Executes the agent with provided input data.

### Terminate Agent

**POST** `/agent/terminate`

Terminates the agent.

### Update Agent Prompt

**POST** `/agent/update-prompt`

Updates the agent's system prompt.

## Examples

- **Initialize Agent:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/initialize
  ```

- **Update Agent Prompt:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/update-prompt -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"new_prompt": "New prompt"}'
  ```
```

By following this implementation plan, we will successfully integrate agent lifecycle management and dynamic system prompt functionalities into our FastAPI application, ensuring robust operation and clear documentation for users.
