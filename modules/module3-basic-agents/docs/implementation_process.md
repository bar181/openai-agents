   - [✔] **Advanced Router File:**
     - Created `app/routers/advanced_router.py` containing API endpoints for the generic lifecycle agent.
   - [✔] **Endpoint Structure and Integration:**  
     - Defined structured endpoints under logical paths:
       - Basic Agents (`/agents/basic/`):
         - `/lifecycle/initialize`
         - `/lifecycle/execute`
         - `/lifecycle/terminate`
         - `/dynamic-prompt/update`
         - `/dynamic-prompt/execute`
       - Advanced Agents (`/agents/advanced/`):
         - `/generic-lifecycle`
         - `/multi-tool`
     - Integrated comprehensive Swagger documentation for each endpoint.

6. **Update Main Application**
   - [✔] **Router Inclusion:**  
     - Updated `app/main.py` to include both basic and advanced routers:
       ```python
       app.include_router(basic_router.router, prefix="/agents/basic")
       app.include_router(advanced_router.router, prefix="/agents/advanced")
       ```
     - Ensured correct endpoint prefix alignment.

7. **Implement and Verify Tests**
   - [✔] **Basic Agent Tests:**  
     - Created `tests/test_basic_agents.py` with tests covering all basic endpoints.
     - Included tests for initialization, execution, and termination lifecycle.
     - Included tests for dynamic prompt update and execution.
   - [✔] **Advanced Agent Tests:**

     - Included tests for all integrated tools:
       - Echo functionality
       - Math operations
       - String manipulation

       ```bash
       python -m pytest tests/test_basic_agents.py tests/test_advanced_agents.py
       ```

8. **Implement Multi-Tool Agent (Advanced)**
   - [✔] **New File:**
     - Created `app/agents/advanced/multi_tool_agent.py` implementing a sophisticated agent with multi-tool capabilities.
