# Module 3 - Implementation Process

This document summarizes the activities completed for Module 3: Basic OpenAI Agents, specifically covering Agent Lifecycle Management and Dynamic System Prompt functionalities. The checklist below indicates completed tasks with a checkmark (✔).

---

## Checklist of Activities

1. **Setup New Agents Directory**
   - [✔] **Created Subfolder:**  
     - Added `app/agents/basic/` to house basic agent functionalities clearly and logically.

2. **Implement Agent Lifecycle Management**
   - [✔] **New File:**  
     - Created `app/agents/basic/lifecycle_agent.py` implementing lifecycle methods: initialization, execution, and termination.
   - [✔] **Agent Functionality:**  
     - Developed methods:
       - `initialize_agent()` – Initializes lifecycle agent.
       - `execute_agent(input_data)` – Executes agent with input data.
       - `terminate_agent()` – Properly terminates agent.
     - Included simple state-tracking logic to demonstrate agent lifecycle clearly.

3. **Implement Dynamic System Prompt**
   - [✔] **New File:**  
     - Created `app/agents/basic/dynamic_prompt_agent.py` to manage dynamic system prompts.
   - [✔] **Agent Functionality:**  
     - Defined `DynamicPromptAgent` class with methods:
       - `update_prompt(new_prompt)` – Dynamically updates the agent’s system prompt.
       - `execute(input_data)` – Processes input using the current prompt context.
     - Ensured dynamic prompt updating directly influences agent execution.

4. **Update API Router**
   - [✔] **New Router File:**  
     - Created `app/routers/basic_agents.py` containing API endpoints for lifecycle and dynamic prompt agents.
   - [✔] **Endpoint Structure and Integration:**  
     - Defined structured endpoints under logical path `/agents/basic/`:
       - Lifecycle Agent:
         - `/lifecycle/initialize`
         - `/lifecycle/execute`
         - `/lifecycle/terminate`
       - Dynamic Prompt Agent:
         - `/dynamic-prompt/update`
         - `/dynamic-prompt/execute`
     - Integrated comprehensive Swagger documentation for each endpoint.

5. **Update Main Application**
   - [✔] **Router Inclusion:**  
     - Updated `app/main.py` to include new basic agents router:
       ```python
       app.include_router(basic_agents.router, prefix="/agents/basic")
       ```
     - Ensured correct endpoint prefix alignment.

6. **Implement and Verify Tests**
   - [✔] **Test File Creation and Verification:**  
     - Created `tests/test_basic_agents.py` with tests covering all new endpoints.
     - Included tests for initialization, execution, and termination lifecycle.
     - Included tests for dynamic prompt update and execution.
     - Verified tests pass successfully using:
       ```bash
       python -m pytest tests/test_basic_agents.py
       ```

## Summary

All planned tasks for Module 3 have been successfully completed and verified:
- Established a structured agents directory for basic functionalities.
- Implemented robust lifecycle management and dynamic prompt features.
- Integrated clear and logical FastAPI endpoints.
- Developed comprehensive tests confirming endpoint functionality.
