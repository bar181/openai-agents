# Phase 2: Streaming Agents and Tools Integration

## Objective

In Phase 2, we enhance Module 3 by implementing streaming response functionalities and integrating reusable tools. This phase focuses on providing real-time user interactions through streaming text and items and incorporating tools to extend agent capabilities. We will integrate these agents into our FastAPI application, create structured API endpoints, and ensure all functionalities are thoroughly tested and documented.

## Steps Overview

### Step 1: Implement Streaming Text Agent

**Description:**  
Develop an agent capable of streaming text responses incrementally to users, enhancing real-time interaction and feedback.

**Actions:**

- Create a new agent file: `app/agents/basic/stream_text_agent.py`.
- Implement functionality to generate and stream text progressively.
- Manage asynchronous response handling to ensure smooth streaming.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
class StreamTextAgent:
    async def generate_text_stream(prompt):
        # Generate text incrementally
        for chunk in generate_chunks(prompt):
            yield chunk
```

### Step 2: Implement Streaming Items Agent

**Description:**  
Create an agent that streams sequences of structured items (e.g., jokes, facts, or bullet points) in real-time to enhance dynamic content delivery.

**Actions:**

- Create a new agent file: `app/agents/basic/stream_items_agent.py`.
- Implement item generation logic with real-time streaming.
- Ensure controlled delays or asynchronous handling for proper streaming effects.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
class StreamItemsAgent:
    async def generate_items_stream(category):
        # Generate items incrementally based on category
        for item in fetch_items(category):
            yield item
```

---

### Step 3: Develop and Integrate Agent Tools

**Description:**  
Define reusable tools that basic agents can utilize, such as data-fetching tools, utilities, or calculators, enhancing their functionality and reusability.

**Actions:**

- Create a tools definition file: `app/agents/basic/tools.py`.
- Define reusable functions or utilities (e.g., weather fetching, calculations).
- Integrate these tools with existing agents, making them accessible through function tools.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
@function_tool
def fetch_weather(location):
    # Fetch weather data for location
    return weather_info
```

---

### Step 4: API Integration and Endpoint Setup

**Description:**  
Expose streaming functionalities and tools via structured FastAPI endpoints, allowing external clients to interact with agents in real-time.

**Actions:**

- Update `app/routers/basic_agents.py` to include new streaming endpoints:
  - `/stream-text`: Endpoint to stream text responses.
  - `/stream-items`: Endpoint to stream sequential items.
- Clearly define request and response schemas using Pydantic models.
- Provide comprehensive Swagger documentation for seamless developer interaction.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
@router.post("/stream-text", dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)])
async def stream_text_endpoint(prompt: PromptRequest):
    # Stream text response from agent
    pass

@router.post("/stream-items", dependencies=[Depends(verify_api_key)])
async def stream_items_endpoint(category: CategoryRequest):
    # Stream items response from agent
    pass
```

---

### Step 5: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation Update

**Description:**  
Ensure that streaming functionalities and tool integrations operate correctly and update documentation to guide users in leveraging these new features.

**Actions:**

- Write and execute tests (`tests/test_stream_text.py`, `tests/test_stream_items.py`) to verify correct streaming behavior.
- Confirm integration and functionality of tools through unit and integration tests.
- Update Swagger UI and documentation to clearly illustrate streaming endpoints and available tools.

**Pseudocode (Testing):**

```python
def test_stream_text():
    response = client.post("/agents/basic/stream-text", json={"prompt": "Tell me a story."})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Check streaming behavior

def test_stream_items():
    response = client.post("/agents/basic/stream-items", json={"category": "jokes"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # Check items are streamed correctly
```

By following these structured steps, Phase 2 will significantly enhance Module 3, providing robust streaming capabilities, reusable agent tools, and a well-integrated API experience.
