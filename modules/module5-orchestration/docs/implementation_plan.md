# Module 5: Guardrails, Handoffs, and Tracing — Implementation Plan

This plan includes 5 phases designed to implement advanced OpenAI Agents SDK features: Guardrails, Handoffs, and Tracing. It builds upon the prior modules' foundations.

---

## Phase 1 — Environment & Initial Setup

1. **Create directory structure** under `module5-guardrails-handoffs-tracing/`:
   - `app/agents/guardrails/`
   - `app/agents/handoffs/`
   - `app/tracing/`
   - `app/routers/advanced_agents_router.py`
   - `tests/`
   - `docs/`
2. **Initialize environment variables** in `.env`:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. **Set up basic logging and tracing configurations**:
   - Configure logging levels and handlers
   - Confirm tracing initialization
4. **Draft placeholder tests**:
   - `test_guardrails.py`
   - `test_handoffs.py`
   - `test_tracing.py`

**Exit Criteria:**
- Established project structure
- Configured `.env` and logging
- Placeholder tests drafted

---

## Phase 2 — Guardrails Implementation

1. **Create Input Guardrails**:
   - Define input guardrail functions to validate inputs (e.g., checking for prohibited content)
   - Implement decorators: `@input_guardrail`
2. **Create Output Guardrails**:
   - Define output guardrail functions to validate agent outputs (e.g., content accuracy, appropriateness)
   - Implement decorators: `@output_guardrail`
3. **Integrate Guardrails with Agents**:
   - Include guardrails in agent initialization
4. **Develop comprehensive tests** (`test_guardrails.py`):
   - Validate triggering and non-triggering scenarios
   - Test both input and output guardrails

**Exit Criteria:**
- Functional guardrails implemented
- Passing tests demonstrating proper guardrail triggers

---

## Phase 3 — Agent Handoffs Implementation

1. **Implement Handoff Logic**:
   - Define specialized sub-agents for specific tasks (e.g., billing, support)
   - Implement `handoff()` function with JSON schema validation
2. **Agent Delegation**:
   - Create a triage agent to delegate tasks using handoffs
3. **Input Filtering for Handoffs**:
   - Implement `HandoffInputFilter` to control information flow between agents
4. **Comprehensive Handoff Tests** (`test_handoffs.py`):
   - Test delegation between multiple agents
   - Validate input filtering logic

**Exit Criteria:**
- Functional handoff implementation
- Tests confirming seamless agent delegation

---

## Phase 4 — Tracing & Debugging Integration

1. **Enable Tracing in OpenAI Agents SDK**:
   - Implement tracing context managers (`with trace(...)`)
   - Customize tracing event processors as needed
2. **Trace Visibility**:
   - Ensure detailed trace capturing (LLM calls, guardrails, tool usage, handoffs)
   - Integrate OpenAI tracing viewer or custom trace processor
3. **Implement Trace Handling and Logging**:
   - Configure detailed logging for trace events
   - Verify sensitive data handling and environment variables
4. **Develop Tracing Tests** (`test_tracing.py`):
   - Validate tracing functionality, span capturing, and trace completeness

**Exit Criteria:**
- Comprehensive tracing enabled
- Passing tests for trace capturing and logging

---

## Phase 5 — Documentation & Final Checks

1. **Finalize Documentation** in `docs/`:
   - `phase1.md` through `phase5.md` (detailed step-by-step instructions)
   - `guidelines.md` (coding, testing, logging standards)
   - `implementation_process.md` (complete checklist)
   - `README.md` (clear module overview and usage)
   - `tutorial.md` (comprehensive setup and usage guide)
2. **Final Review and Validation**:
   - Run complete test suite, confirm all pass
   - Review and analyze trace logs for consistency
   - Verify functionality end-to-end (guardrails, handoffs, tracing)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Complete, verified documentation
- Passing all tests and validation checks
- Comprehensive end-to-end functionality verified

---

## Common Documentation Included:

Ensure the following common documents are reviewed or updated:

- `/common/PackageOpanAIAgents.md`
- `/common/OpenAIAgentsSDK.md`
- `common/guidelines.md` (update with guardrail and handoff best practices)

Upon completing Module 5, you'll have advanced proficiency in implementing critical OpenAI Agents features: Guardrails, Handoffs, and Tracing, setting the stage for future integrations such as Supabase for state management and logging.
