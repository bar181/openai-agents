# Module 5: Orchestration - Overview and Endpoints

**Module Goal**:  
To orchestrate interactions between multiple specialized AI agents using advanced orchestration patterns such as handoffs, guardrails, tracing, and state management. It will enable intelligent task delegation, enforce safety constraints, and provide full traceability.

**Key Features of Module 5**:
- Input and Output Guardrails
- Agent-to-Agent Handoffs
- Comprehensive Tracing
- State Management (In-Memory)
- Advanced Orchestration Patterns (Agent routing, message filtering)

## User Stories & Endpoint Overview

### Endpoint 1: Input Guardrails

**User Story**:  
_As a user or developer, I want the system to automatically validate user inputs against predefined criteria to prevent inappropriate or off-topic requests from being processed._

**Example**:
- User inputs a potentially harmful request.
- Guardrail evaluates and blocks the request if inappropriate.
- User receives feedback explaining why the input was rejected.

**SDK Files Involved**:
- [`guardrail.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/guardrail.py)
- [`agent.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/agent.py)
- [`run_context.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/run_context.py)

---

### Endpoint 2: Output Guardrails

**User Story**:  
_As a developer, I want to validate AI outputs against business rules or compliance constraints to ensure responses remain safe, accurate, and relevant before delivery._

**Example**:
- AI agent generates a response.
- Output guardrail reviews the response.
- If the response violates business rules, itâ€™s flagged or rejected with a clear explanation.

**SDK Files Involved**:
- [`guardrail.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/guardrail.py)
- [`agent_output.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/agent_output.py)

---

### Endpoint 3: Agent Handoffs

**User Story**:  
_As an application developer, I want specialized agents to automatically handoff tasks to other agents based on the user's input or task complexity, to improve efficiency and accuracy._

**Example**:
- User asks a complex financial question.
- Initial agent identifies complexity and hands off to specialized `financial_research_agent`.
- Specialized agent responds effectively.

**SDK Files Involved**:
- [`handoffs.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/handoffs.py)
- [`agent.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/agent.py)
- [`handoffs.md` (example usage)](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/docs/handoffs.md)
- Examples:
  - [`message_filter.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/handoffs/message_filter.py)
  - [`message_filter_streaming.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/handoffs/message_filter_streaming.py)

---

### Endpoint 4: Comprehensive Tracing

**User Story**:  
_As a system administrator or developer, I want full traceability of agent actions, including handoffs and guardrail activations, to easily debug and audit agent behaviors._

**Example**:
- User interaction triggers multiple agents and handoffs.
- Administrator views complete interaction trace via a tracing UI or logs.
- Each step, input, output, guardrail trigger, and handoff clearly shown.

**SDK Files Involved**:
- [`tracing/`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/src/agents/tracing)
  - `create.py`
  - `logger.py`
  - `spans.py`
  - `traces.py`
  - `processor_interface.py`

---

### Endpoint 5: Advanced Orchestration (Message Filtering & Routing)

**User Story**:  
_As a developer, I want advanced orchestration logic such as routing messages to appropriate agents based on input type or content, allowing for seamless, intelligent handling of user interactions._

**Example**:
- User asks for help that spans multiple agent specializations (e.g., math and history).
- Routing logic splits or routes the request intelligently to suitable agents.
- Responses from multiple agents are aggregated into one coherent reply.

**SDK Files Involved**:
- [`handoffs.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/handoffs.py)
- [`handoff_filters.py`](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/src/agents/extensions/handoff_filters.py)

## Module 5 Implementation Plan Outline

### Phase 1: Environment & Setup
- Copy all files from Module 4 (completed).
- Prepare and verify existing agents from Module 4 work correctly.
- Add placeholder directories and files for new orchestration features:
  - Guardrails (`input_guardrails.py`, `output_guardrails.py`)
  - Handoffs (`handoff_agent.py`, `handoff_router.py`)
  - Tracing (`trace_processor.py`)

### Phase 2: Implement Input & Output Guardrails
- Implement input guardrails using the SDK's `guardrail.py`.
- Implement output guardrails for validating AI responses.
- Integrate with existing endpoints from Module 4 without modifying original agent implementations.

### Phase 3: Implement Agent Handoffs
- Add handoff mechanisms using `handoffs.py`.
- Include examples from OpenAI SDK (`message_filter.py`, `message_filter_streaming.py`).
- Ensure seamless task delegation between agents.

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Tracing Implementation
- Implement comprehensive tracing for guardrails and handoffs.
- Leverage SDK's tracing functionality (`tracing` package).

### Phase 5: Advanced Orchestration (Routing and Filtering)
- Develop intelligent routing logic and filtering of agent messages.
- Integrate routing patterns for intelligent task management across multiple specialized agents.

### Phase 6: Final Documentation & Tests
- Document full functionality with clear guidelines and tutorials.
- Create final integration tests to ensure orchestration works seamlessly with existing Module 4 features.

## Key Implementation Notes for Developers:
- **Do not modify existing files from Module 4**, only add new orchestration-related features.
- Follow the existing project structure and guidelines from previous modules to maintain consistency.
- Ensure clear separation of concerns:
  - Guardrails strictly validate and control inputs/outputs.
  - Handoffs strictly delegate tasks between agents.
  - Tracing strictly tracks all orchestration actions for transparency.

## Conclusion
Module 5 will significantly enhance the functionality of the AI agent monorepo by introducing advanced orchestration patterns, ensuring robust interactions between agents, and maintaining a high standard of safety and auditability throughout the application lifecycle.
