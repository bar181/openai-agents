## Phase 1: Environment & Setup

Before diving into code, we'll prepare your workspace to ensure a smooth development experience.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Project Directory Structure:**
   - Create a directory structure that supports orchestration components
   - Set up folders for guardrails, handoffs, and tracing

2. **Configuration Setup:**
   - Configure environment variables for orchestration settings
   - Set up logging levels for tracing and debugging

3. **Placeholder Files:**
   - Create placeholder files for guardrails, handoffs, and tracing
   - Set up basic router structure for orchestration endpoints

4. **Testing Framework:**
   - Prepare test files for each orchestration component
   - Set up mock objects for testing agent interactions

## Phase 2: Input & Output Guardrails

Guardrails are essential for ensuring that agent interactions remain safe, appropriate, and within defined boundaries.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Input Guardrails:**
   - Create `input_guardrails.py` to validate user inputs before processing
   - Implement guardrails for:
     - Empty input validation
     - Input length validation
     - Harmful content detection
     - Inappropriate language detection
   - Use the `@input_guardrail()` decorator from the OpenAI Agents SDK

2. **Output Guardrails:**
   - Create `output_guardrails.py` to validate agent outputs before returning to users
   - Implement guardrails for:
     - Empty output validation
     - Output length validation
     - Error detection in outputs
     - Output format validation
   - Use the `@output_guardrail()` decorator from the OpenAI Agents SDK

3. **Guardrail Agent:**
   - Create a `GuardrailAgent` class that combines input and output guardrails
   - Implement a factory function for easy agent creation with configurable guardrails
   - Ensure proper error handling for guardrail tripwires

4. **Router Integration:**
   - Add endpoints for testing input and output guardrails
   - Implement error handling for guardrail violations
   - Create test endpoints for individual guardrail testing

## Phase 3: Agent Handoffs

Agent handoffs enable specialized agents to handle specific types of tasks, improving efficiency and response quality.

### Key Components

1. **Specialized Agents:**
   - **Billing Agent:** Handles billing inquiries, payment issues, and invoice questions
   - **Technical Support Agent:** Resolves technical issues, troubleshooting, and system problems
   - **Customer Service Agent:** Manages general inquiries and non-technical assistance
   - Each agent is specialized with specific instructions and capabilities

2. **Handoff Mechanism:**
   - Create `handoff_agent.py` to implement agent-to-agent handoffs
   - Implement the `HandoffAgent` class that can delegate tasks to specialized agents
   - Use the OpenAI Agents SDK's `handoff()` function to create handoff instances
   - Create a factory function for easy handoff agent creation

3. **Message Filtering:**
   - Implement message filters for each specialized agent type:
     - `filter_billing_messages` for billing-related content
     - `filter_technical_messages` for technical support-related content
     - `filter_customer_service_messages` for customer service-related content
   - Ensure only relevant information is passed during handoffs
   - Add appropriate context for specialized agents

4. **Agent Type Determination:**
   - Implement keyword-based routing to determine the appropriate agent type
   - Create logic to analyze user messages and route to the correct specialized agent
   - Ensure seamless delegation based on message content

5. **Router Integration:**
   - Add `/handoffs` endpoint for processing requests with specialized agents
   - Add `/handoffs/triage` endpoint for determining which agent should handle a request
   - Implement error handling for handoff failures

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Tracing

Tracing provides visibility into agent interactions, making debugging and monitoring easier.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Trace Processor:**
   - Create `trace_processor.py` to capture and process trace information
   - Implement tracing for guardrails and handoffs
   - Capture detailed information about agent interactions

2. **Trace Visualization:**
   - Implement methods to visualize agent interaction traces
   - Create a clear representation of handoff flows
   - Enable debugging of complex agent interactions

3. **Router Integration:**
   - Add endpoints for retrieving trace information
   - Implement trace status checking
   - Enable trace filtering and searching

## Phase 5: Advanced Orchestration

Advanced orchestration patterns enable more sophisticated agent interactions and routing.

### Key Components

1. **Message Routing:**
   - Implement intelligent message routing based on content analysis
   - Create routing rules for different types of requests
   - Enable dynamic routing based on agent availability and specialization

2. **State Management:**
   - Implement in-memory state management for agent interactions
   - Maintain context across multiple interactions
   - Enable stateful conversations with multiple agents

3. **Router Integration:**
   - Add endpoints for advanced orchestration patterns
   - Implement state management endpoints
   - Create configuration endpoints for routing rules

## Phase 6: Documentation & Final Checks

Comprehensive documentation and thorough testing ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Documentation Steps

- Document each phase in detail
- Create clear usage examples for each orchestration pattern
- Update the main README with orchestration capabilities

### Final Testing
