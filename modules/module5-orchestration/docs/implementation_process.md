# Module 5 â€“ Orchestration: Implementation Process

This document tracks the implementation progress of Module 5, which focuses on advanced orchestration patterns including guardrails, agent-to-agent handoffs, comprehensive tracing, and message routing.

## Phase 1 Updates

- Created orchestration folder structure:
  - `app/agents/orchestration/` directory with placeholder files
  - `app/routers/orchestration_router.py` for API endpoints
  - `tests/test_orchestration.py` for placeholder tests

- Added placeholder files:
  - `input_guardrails.py` for validating user inputs
  - `output_guardrails.py` for validating agent outputs
  - `handoff_agent.py` for agent-to-agent handoffs
  - `trace_processor.py` for tracing agent interactions

- Updated configuration:
  - Added orchestration-specific environment variables to `app/config.py`
  - Added `TRACE_LOG_LEVEL` and `ORCHESTRATION_MODE` variables

- Created placeholder tests:
  - Basic tests for input/output guardrails
  - Basic tests for handoffs
  - Basic tests for trace processor
  - Configuration verification test

- Next steps:
  - Implement detailed input guardrails in Phase 2
  - Implement detailed output guardrails in Phase 2
  - Develop comprehensive test suite for guardrails

## Phase 2 Updates

- Implemented input guardrails:
  - Created `validate_empty_input` guardrail to check for empty inputs
  - Created `validate_input_length` guardrail to check for excessively long inputs
  - Created `validate_harmful_content` guardrail to check for potentially harmful content
  - Created `validate_inappropriate_language` guardrail to check for inappropriate language
  - Used the `@input_guardrail()` decorator from the OpenAI Agents SDK

- Implemented output guardrails:
  - Created `validate_output_not_empty` guardrail to check for empty outputs
  - Created `validate_output_length` guardrail to check for excessively long outputs
  - Created `validate_no_error_in_output` guardrail to check for error messages in outputs
  - Created `validate_output_format` guardrail to check for correct output format
  - Used the `@output_guardrail()` decorator from the OpenAI Agents SDK

- Created a guardrail agent:
  - Implemented `GuardrailAgent` class that uses input and output guardrails
  - Created a factory function `create_guardrail_agent` for easy agent creation
  - Configured default guardrails for the agent

- Updated the orchestration router:
  - Added endpoints for input guardrails
  - Added endpoints for output guardrails
  - Added test endpoints for guardrails
  - Implemented error handling for guardrail tripwires

- Developed comprehensive tests:
  - Added tests for each input guardrail
  - Added tests for each output guardrail
  - Added tests for the guardrail agent
  - Ensured all tests pass

- Next steps:
  - Implement agent-to-agent handoffs in Phase 3
  - Develop handoff mechanisms and criteria
  - Create specialized agents for different tasks
