# Module 5 â€“ Orchestration: Implementation Process

This document tracks the implementation progress of Module 5, which focuses on advanced orchestration patterns including guardrails, agent-to-agent handoffs, comprehensive tracing, and message routing.

## Phase 1 Updates

- Created orchestration folder structure:
  - `app/agents/orchestration/` directory with placeholder files
  - `app/routers/orchestration_router.py` for API endpoints
  - `tests/test_orchestration.py` for placeholder tests

- Added placeholder files:
  - `input_guardrails.py` for validating user inputs
  - `output_guardrails.py` for validating agent outputs
  - `handoff_agent.py` for agent-to-agent handoffs
  - `trace_processor.py` for tracing agent interactions

- Updated configuration:
  - Added orchestration-specific environment variables to `app/config.py`
  - Added `TRACE_LOG_LEVEL` and `ORCHESTRATION_MODE` variables

- Created placeholder tests:
  - Basic tests for input/output guardrails
  - Basic tests for handoffs
  - Basic tests for trace processor
  - Configuration verification test

- Next steps:
  - Implement detailed input guardrails in Phase 2
  - Implement detailed output guardrails in Phase 2
  - Develop comprehensive test suite for guardrails
