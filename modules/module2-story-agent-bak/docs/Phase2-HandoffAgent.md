# Phase 2: Handoff (Routing) Agent Implementation

## Overview

This phase focuses on implementing the handoff/routing agent pattern, which enables task delegation to specialized sub-agents based on specific criteria. The agent analyzes user input and routes requests to appropriate specialized agents.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Structure Setup
- Create `routing_agent.py` in the `/app/agents` directory
- Set up triage agent class with proper docstrings
- Implement configuration for routing criteria

### 2. Sub-Agent Implementation
- Create specialized sub-agents:
  * Language-specific agents (e.g., English, Spanish)
  * Task-specific agents (based on request type)
- Implement sub-agent base class for common functionality
- Configure handoff mechanisms between agents

### 3. Routing Logic
- Implement criteria detection (language, task type)
- Create routing decision logic
- Add fallback handling for unmatched cases
- Implement handoff protocol using SDK's handoff features

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Create `test_routing_agent.py` in `/tests` directory
- Implement unit tests for:
  * Triage logic accuracy
  * Sub-agent delegation
  * Fallback behavior
  * Error handling
- Create integration tests for full routing workflow

### 5. API Integration
- Create FastAPI endpoint for routing agent
- Implement input validation
- Add error handling and response formatting
- Ensure proper API key verification

### 6. Documentation
- Update implementation progress
- Document API endpoints
- Add usage examples
- Document testing procedures

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
- Accurate request classification
- Proper sub-agent delegation
- Successful handoffs between agents
- Effective fallback handling

2. **Testing**
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests confirm routing accuracy
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Test coverage meets requirements

3. **Code Quality**
- Follows project standards
- Well-documented code
- Maintainable architecture
- Secure implementation

## Dependencies

- OpenAI Agents SDK (handoff features)
- FastAPI framework
- Testing libraries
- Environment configuration

## Timeline

1. Basic Structure Setup: 1 day
2. Sub-Agent Implementation: 2 days
3. Routing Logic: 2-3 days
4. Testing Infrastructure: 2 days
5. API Integration: 1 day
6. Documentation: 1 day

Total Estimated Time: 9-10 days

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
- Complex routing logic: Implement clear decision trees
- Sub-agent coordination: Use SDK's handoff features properly
- State management: Maintain clean handoff protocols

2. **Testing Risks**
- Complex test scenarios: Create comprehensive test suite
- Integration challenges: Proper mocking and isolation

3. **Security Risks**
- Input validation: Thorough validation at all levels
- API security: Proper key verification
- Data handling: Secure transfer between agents

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2:
1. Review and refine implementation
2. Gather feedback from team
3. Begin planning Phase 3 (Combined Agent)
4. Update documentation with lessons learned
