# Plans Overview - Module 2

This document provides a summary of all planning materials for Module 2 (Core Research Agents & Advanced Patterns).  It serves as a central reference point for the project's goals, structure, and progress.

**Documents:**

*   **Development Plans (`DevelopmentPlans.md`):**
    *   Describes the structured approach for introducing the three new agent patterns: deterministic, routing (handoff), and combined.
    *   Outlines the key objectives and desired outcomes for the module.
*   **Guidance (`Guidance.md`):**
    *   Provides coding standards, best practices, and project organizational guidelines.
    *   Ensures consistency with Module 1's conventions while accommodating the more complex logic of multi-step and multi-agent workflows.
*   **Tests (`Tests.md`):**
    *   Presents a comprehensive testing strategy for all three agent patterns.
    *   Covers unit tests, integration tests, in-memory state testing, and endpoint testing.
*   **Implementation Progress (`ImplementationProgress.md`):**
    *   Tracks the development status of each agent (deterministic, routing, combined).
    *   Logs any issues encountered during development and how they were resolved.
    *   Outlines the next steps for completing the module.
*   **Packages Details for OpenAI Agents (`PackagesDetailsForOpenAIAgents.md`):**
    *   Provides a detailed reference guide to the relevant features of the OpenAI Agents SDK.
    *   Includes code snippets and explanations for deterministic flows, handoffs, function calling, in-memory state management, and other key concepts.

**Overall Summary:**

Module 2 significantly expands upon the basic "Hello World" agent from Module 1.  It introduces multi-step logic (deterministic workflows), sub-agent orchestration (handoffs/routing), and the combination of these patterns. Each document in this overview plays a crucial role in ensuring a well-structured, well-documented, and thoroughly tested development process.  This modular approach facilitates maintainability, extensibility, and collaboration, and prepares the groundwork for more advanced features in future modules.
