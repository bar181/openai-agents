# Implementation Plan Overview - Module 2

## Project Structure

The implementation of Module 2 is divided into three main phases, each focusing on a specific agent pattern:

1. **Phase 1: Deterministic Agent**
   - Multi-step workflow execution
   - Sequential processing
   - State management between steps
   - Estimated time: 7-8 days

2. **Phase 2: Handoff (Routing) Agent**
   - Request classification
   - Sub-agent delegation
   - Fallback handling
   - Estimated time: 9-10 days

3. **Phase 3: Combined Agent**
   - Integration of both patterns
   - Complex workflow orchestration
   - Cross-pattern state management
   - Estimated time: 9-11 days


## Key Deliverables

### Code Components
- Deterministic agent implementation (`deterministic_agent.py`)
- Routing agent implementation (`routing_agent.py`)
- Combined agent implementation (`combined_agent.py`)
- Associated test files for each agent
- FastAPI endpoints for each agent
- Utility functions and shared components

### Documentation
- Detailed implementation guides
- API documentation
- Testing procedures
- Usage examples
- Progress tracking

### Testing Assets
- Unit test suites
- Integration tests
- Test fixtures and helpers
- Testing documentation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase Sequencing
1. Complete Phase 1 (Deterministic) first
2. Proceed to Phase 2 (Handoff) after Phase 1 review
3. Begin Phase 3 (Combined) after both patterns are stable
4. Final integration and system testing

### Quality Assurance
- Regular code reviews
- Continuous testing
- Documentation updates
- Security audits

### Risk Management
- Technical risk mitigation
- Testing coverage
- Security considerations
- Performance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Functionality
