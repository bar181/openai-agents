# Module 2 Implementation Plan: Story Telling Agent

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement Module 2, which focuses on creating a Story Telling Agent. This module builds upon the concepts from Module 1 and uses the OpenAI Agents deterministic example as its foundation.

---

## 1. Overview

**Module Goal:**  
Develop a functional Story Telling Agent that initially replicates the behavior of the deterministic agent example and then customizes it to generate coherent, engaging stories based on user input.

**Key Components:**
- Base implementation using the deterministic agent pattern from [OpenAI Agents deterministic.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/deterministic.py).
- Customization and refinement to transform the deterministic agent into a story telling agent.
- Integration with FastAPI for API exposure.
- Comprehensive testing and documentation.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python Version:** 3.10+
- **Environment:** Virtual environment set up with dependencies (as listed in the module's `requirements.txt`)
- **Dependencies:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, python-dotenv, openai, pydantic, openai-agents, pytest, pytest-asyncio
- **Configuration:** Properly configured environment variables in the `.env` file (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`)

---

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create a Working Deterministic Agent
- **Objective:**  
  - Implement a working agent based on the deterministic agent pattern.
  - Adapt the code from the OpenAI deterministic example so that it functions as a baseline agent.
- **Tasks:**
  - Review and analyze the code from `deterministic.py` in the OpenAI Agents examples.
  - Create the agent file (e.g., `story_telling_agent.py`) under `app/agents/` that replicates the deterministic behavior.
  - Set up the corresponding FastAPI router in `app/routers/` (e.g., `story_telling_router.py`) to expose the agent via an API endpoint.
  - Ensure all configurations, dependencies, and testing utilities are in place.
- **Milestones:**
  - A fully functional deterministic agent that responds correctly to user input.
  - End-to-end API testing for the baseline agent functionality.

### Phase 2: Customize for a Story Telling Agent
- **Objective:**  
  - Extend and customize the baseline deterministic agent to generate story outlines, story bodies, and endings.
  - Incorporate additional logic or modifications that make the agent more suitable for creative story generation.
- **Tasks:**
  - Modify the agent's instructions and tool functions to align with a story telling workflow.
  - Optionally, break the agent functionality into sub-agents (e.g., outline generator, story body generator, ending generator) if needed.
  - Update the FastAPI router to reflect any changes or additional endpoints.
  - Enhance Swagger documentation to include detailed descriptions for story generation endpoints.
- **Milestones:**
  - A customized story telling agent that takes a userâ€™s topic and returns a structured story.
  - Clear API documentation and test cases verifying that story components (outline, main text, ending) are generated as expected.

---

## 4. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Validate individual functions and tool methods used in the agent for correctness.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  Use FastAPI's `TestClient` to simulate API requests and verify that the endpoints for the story telling agent work correctly.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Ensure proper error messages are returned for invalid input or failed agent processing.
- **Milestones:**
  - Passing tests for both the deterministic base implementation and the customized story telling features.

---

## 5. Documentation and Resources

- **Code Documentation:**  
  Each file should include the file name and path as a header comment. Ensure that functions have clear docstrings and inline comments.
- **Tutorial and Guidance:**  
  Update module-specific tutorials and code snippets in the `docs/` folder as development progresses.
- **Reference Materials:**  
  Consult the [OpenAI Agents deterministic example](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/deterministic.py) for baseline logic and implementation ideas.

---

## 6. Deployment

- **Local Deployment:**  
  Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI server and verify that endpoints are accessible via Swagger UI.
- **Validation:**  
  Confirm that the environment variables load correctly and the agent responds as expected to various inputs.

---

## 7. Next Steps

- **Phase Documentation:**  
  Later, two additional `/plans` documents will be created, detailing code snippets for `main.py`, routers, agents, and tests.
- **Feedback & Iteration:**  
  Gather feedback on the agent's performance and make iterative improvements.
- **Preparation for Advanced Features:**  
  Begin planning for future modules that might extend or build upon the story telling agent.
