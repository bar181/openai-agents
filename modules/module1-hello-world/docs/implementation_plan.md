# Module 1 Implementation Plan: Hello World Agent

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for Module 1: creating a basic "Hello World" agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK and FastAPI. It provides an overview of the goals, setup requirements, detailed implementation phases (each documented separately), testing procedures, and documentation standards.

---

## 1. Overview

**Module Goal:**

Establish a foundational AI agent that can be expanded upon in subsequent modules. The agent will use FastAPI for API exposure and OpenAI's SDK for functionality.

**Key Components:**
- Agent Logic (`hello_world_agent.py`)
- API Endpoint via FastAPI Router (`hello_world_router.py`)
- Configuration Management (`config.py`)
- Dependency and Authentication Setup (`dependencies.py`)
- Documentation and Testing

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher
- **Virtual Environment:** Python virtual environment setup
- **Dependencies:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, openai, python-dotenv, pydantic, pytest, pytest-asyncio
- **Configuration:** `.env` file including `OPENAI_API_KEY` and custom `API_KEY`

---

## 3. Implementation Phases

Detailed instructions and tasks for each phase will be provided in separate documents:

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Project Initialization

Refer to `phase1.md` for detailed steps:

- Create and activate virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Set up configuration file (`config.py`)
- Verify directory structure

### Phase 2: Agent Implementation

Refer to `phase2.md` for detailed instructions:

- Implement basic agent logic in `hello_world_agent.py`
- Define agent tools and instructions
- Write asynchronous runner logic for agent execution

### Phase 3: API Router and Endpoint Creation

Refer to `phase3.md` for detailed guidelines:

- Develop API endpoints in `hello_world_router.py`
- Implement Swagger documentation
- Configure API endpoint security using API key authentication

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

Refer to `phase4.md` for comprehensive testing procedures:

- Integrate agent and router into FastAPI application (`main.py`)
- Write and execute tests in `tests/test_hello_world.py`
- Validate endpoint functionality and error handling

### Phase 5: Documentation and Final Review

Refer to `phase5.md` for documentation and review standards:

- Update and refine module-specific documentation (`docs/`)
- Conduct thorough code reviews and refactoring for quality
- Ensure Swagger documentation accuracy and completeness

---

## 4. Milestones & Deliverables

- **Milestone 1:** Completed environment setup and initial project structure (`Phase 1`).
- **Milestone 2:** Fully functional Hello World agent (`Phase 2`).
- **Milestone 3:** Secure API endpoint accessible and integrated (`Phase 3`).
- **Milestone 4:** Successful integration tests passing all test cases (`Phase 4`).
- **Milestone 5:** Comprehensive documentation and final code review completed (`Phase 5`).

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Validate core functionality and error handling.
- **Integration Tests:** Use FastAPI's `TestClient` to ensure API endpoints perform as expected.
- **Documentation Validation:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of Swagger documentation.

---

## 6. Deployment

- **Local Deployment:** Use Uvicorn for local server setup and validate API functionality.
- **Environment Checks:** Ensure environment variables are correctly loaded and functional.

---

## 7. Documentation and Resources

- General guidelines: Refer to `/common/guidance.md`
- Testing practices: Refer to `/common/tests.md`
- Recommended external resources:
  - [OpenAI Python SDK Documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
  - [FastAPI Official Documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

---

## 8. Next Steps

Upon successful completion of Module 1:
- Finalize and publish documentation.
- Prepare for feedback and iterative improvements.
- Begin preparation for Module 2 (Storytelling Agent).
