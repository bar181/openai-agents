# Module 1 Implementation Plan: Hello World Agent

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement Module 1, which introduces the Hello World agent. The plan details the goals, required setup, implementation phases, testing procedures, and documentation requirements for this module.

---

## 1. Overview

**Module Goal:**  
Build a basic, self-contained Hello World agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK and FastAPI. This module serves as the foundational building block for subsequent modules.

**Key Components:**
- Agent logic implementation (hello_world_agent)
- API exposure via FastAPI router
- Basic configuration and dependency management
- Comprehensive documentation and testing

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python Version:** 3.10+
- **Environment:** Virtual environment with dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Dependencies:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, python-dotenv, openai, pydantic, openai-agents, pytest, pytest-asyncio
- **Configuration:** Environment variables set in a `.env` file, including `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `API_KEY`

---

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Project Initialization
- **Setup Virtual Environment:** Create and activate a virtual environment.
- **Install Dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Configuration File:** Create `app/config.py` to load environment variables.
- **Directory Structure:** Verify that the monorepo structure (modules, docs, tests) is in place.

### Phase 2: Agent Implementation
- **Develop Agent Logic:**  
  - Create `app/agents/hello_world_agent.py` with a function tool that returns "Hello, world!".
  - Instantiate the agent with clear instructions and defined tools.
  - Implement asynchronous runner logic to handle agent execution.

### Phase 3: API Router and Endpoint Creation
- **Router Development:**  
  - Create `app/routers/hello_world_router.py` to define an endpoint that triggers the Hello World agent.
  - Include comprehensive Swagger documentation directly in route docstrings.
  - Set up endpoint security using API key validation via `app/dependencies.py`.

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- **Main Application:**  
  - Create `app/main.py` to initialize the FastAPI app and include the hello world router.
- **Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests in `tests/test_hello_world.py` to validate the endpoint.
  - Ensure tests cover both successful execution and error handling scenarios.

### Phase 5: Documentation and Final Review
- **Documentation:**  
  - Update the module-specific documentation in `docs/` with detailed tutorials and guidance.
  - Ensure that code snippets, configuration steps, and troubleshooting tips are included.
- **Code Review:**  
  - Conduct a final review and refactor for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to PEP 8 standards.
  - Validate that Swagger documentation is complete and accurate.

## 4. Milestones & Deliverables

- **Milestone 1:** Environment and project structure ready.  
  *Deliverable:* Virtual environment, installed dependencies, initial project scaffold.

- **Milestone 2:** Hello World Agent implemented and functional.  
  *Deliverable:* `app/agents/hello_world_agent.py` with a working agent.

- **Milestone 3:** API endpoint exposed and secured.  
  *Deliverable:* `app/routers/hello_world_router.py` and integration in `app/main.py`.

- **Milestone 4:** Successful integration tests.  
  *Deliverable:* Passing tests in `tests/test_hello_world.py`.

- **Milestone 5:** Complete documentation and code review.  
  *Deliverable:* Updated `docs/` content, finalized code, and guidance notes.

---

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Validate agent output and error handling.
- **Integration Testing:** Use FastAPIâ€™s `TestClient` to simulate API requests.
- **Documentation Testing:** Verify that Swagger UI shows complete and accurate endpoint documentation.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Update test cases as new features or improvements are introduced.

---

## 6. Deployment

- **Local Deployment:**  
  - Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI server.
  - Confirm that endpoints are accessible and functioning via Swagger UI.
- **Environment Validation:**  
  - Check that all environment variables are loaded correctly via `app/config.py`.

---

## 7. Documentation and Resources

- **Guidance Documents:** Refer to `/common/guidance.md` for overall best practices.
- **Testing Guidelines:** See `/common/tests.md` for testing standards.
- **Additional Resources:**  
  - OpenAI Agents SDK Documentation  
  - FastAPI Best Practices

---

## 8. Next Steps

Upon successful implementation of Module 1:
- Review and refine the documentation.
- Prepare feedback for learners.
- Begin planning for Module 2, which will extend functionality (e.g., Story Telling Agent).
