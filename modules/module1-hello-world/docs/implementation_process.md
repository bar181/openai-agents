# Module 1 - Implementation Process

## Checklist of Activities

### Phase 1 — Environment Setup and Project Initialization
- [x] Set up Python environment (Python 3.10+)
- [x] Created virtual environment (`env`)
- [x] Installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- [x] Configured `.env` with required keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`)
- [x] Verified project directory structure
- [x] Created and validated `app/config.py`

### Phase 1 Updates
- Created and activated Python virtual environment successfully.
- Installed all dependencies without errors.
- Verified environment variables loaded correctly from `.env`.
- Confirmed project directory structure matches expected layout.

### Phase 2 — Agent Implementation
- [x] Created agent logic file `hello_world_agent.py`
- [x] Defined `hello_world_tool` using `@function_tool` decorator
- [x] Instantiated `hello_agent` with proper instructions and tools
- [x] Implemented asynchronous runner `run_hello_agent`
- [x] Verified basic agent execution through Python quick check

### Phase 2 Updates
- Agent logic implemented with clear instructions and functionality.
- Runner logic properly handles execution and basic error cases.
- Python quick check confirmed successful agent responses.

### Phase 3 — API Router and Endpoint Creation
- [x] Created FastAPI router file `hello_world.py`
- [x] Defined request and response schemas with Pydantic models
- [x] Created secure endpoint (`/agent/hello`) with API key verification
- [x] Integrated router into main application (`app/main.py`)
- [x] Verified endpoint functionality using Swagger UI

### Phase 3 Updates
- Successfully integrated agent with RESTful endpoint.
- Endpoint security correctly implemented and verified.
- Swagger documentation is accurate and functional.

- [x] Debugged and addressed all testing issues
- [x] Ensured all tests passed successfully

### Phase 4 Updates
- Comprehensive tests developed and passed successfully.
- Endpoint handling and error conditions tested thoroughly.
- Continuous integration strategy recommended.

- [x] Reviewed and refined Swagger UI documentation
- [x] Conducted thorough code review (PEP 8 compliance, readability)
- [x] Final test suite executed successfully
- [x] Verified security handling (API keys and authentication)
- [x] Committed final reviewed version to version control

### Phase 5 Updates
- All documentation refined and accurately reflects project.
