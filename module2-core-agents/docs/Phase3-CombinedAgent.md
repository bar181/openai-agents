# Phase 3: Combined Agent Implementation

## Overview

This phase focuses on implementing the combined agent pattern, which integrates both deterministic and handoff patterns into a single agent. This creates a more versatile agent capable of handling complex workflows that require both sequential steps and specialized delegation.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Structure Setup
- Create `combined_agent.py` in the `/app/agents` directory
- Set up combined agent class with proper docstrings
- Implement configuration handling for both patterns

### 2. Integration of Patterns
- Import and integrate deterministic workflow logic
- Import and integrate handoff/routing logic
- Create unified interface for both patterns
- Implement state management across pattern boundaries

### 3. Workflow Management
- Create workflow orchestration logic
- Implement decision points for pattern switching
- Handle state persistence between patterns
- Manage transitions between steps and handoffs

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Create `test_combined_agent.py` in `/tests` directory
- Implement unit tests for:
  * Pattern integration
  * Workflow transitions
  * State management
  * Error handling
- Create integration tests for complex scenarios

### 5. API Integration
- Create FastAPI endpoint for combined agent
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add error handling and response formatting
- Ensure proper API key verification

### 6. Documentation
- Update implementation progress
- Document API endpoints
- Add usage examples
- Document testing procedures
