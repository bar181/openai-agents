# Implementation Progress - Module 2

**Current Status:**

*   **Deterministic Agent:**
    *   Outline and pseudocode: Completed.
    *   Partial implementation: In progress.  Core logic for step execution is in place, but further refinement and testing are needed.
*   **Handoff Agent:**
    *   Basic triage logic: Drafted.  Language-based routing is implemented.
    *   Specialized sub-agents: Placeholders added.  Need to implement the actual functionality of the sub-agents.
*   **Combined Agent:**
    *   Conceptual design: Complete.
    *   Implementation: Waiting for the deterministic and handoff agents to be finalized before integrating their logic.

**Completed Features & Logs:**

*   Created `deterministic_agent.py` with a multi-step approach.  The agent can execute a sequence of functions (tools).
*   Developed initial unit tests in `tests/test_deterministic_agent.py` to verify the correct sequencing of steps.
*   Started `routing_agent.py` with language-based triage logic.  The agent can route requests to different sub-agents based on detected language.
*   Encountered an issue with user input validation for language detection.  Resolved by adding a fallback sub-agent for unknown or unsupported languages.
*   Wrote `tests/test_routing_agent.py` covering:
    *   Successful routing to different language agents.
    *   Fallback routing to a default agent.
    *   Error conditions (e.g., invalid input).

**Issues Overcome:**

*   **Handling Partial Results:** Initially, partial results were stored in global variables.  This caused concurrency issues and made testing difficult.  Switched to using local in-memory structures (dictionaries passed as context) to store and pass partial results between steps. This improved isolation and testability.
*   **Triage Logic (Default Route):**  The initial triage logic did not handle cases where the user's request did not match any of the defined criteria.  This resulted in errors.  Added a default route (fallback sub-agent) to handle unmatched cases gracefully.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Finalize Deterministic and Routing Logic:** Complete the implementation of the deterministic and routing agents, including thorough testing and refinement.
2.  **Implement Combined Agent:** Begin implementing the combined agent, integrating the logic from the deterministic and routing agents.
3.  **Write End-to-End Integration Tests:** Create end-to-end integration tests to confirm that the multi-agent workflows (including handoffs) function correctly.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Update the project documentation (including this progress report and usage examples) with the new endpoints and agent capabilities.
5.  **Refactor and Improve:**  Refactor the code as needed to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
6.  **Code Review:**  Conduct a code review to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
