# Phase 1: Deterministic Agent Implementation

## Overview

This phase focuses on implementing the deterministic agent pattern, which breaks down complex tasks into a sequence of well-defined steps. The agent executes these steps in a predetermined order, with each step's output becoming the input for the next step.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Basic Structure Setup
- Create `deterministic_agent.py` in the `/app/agents` directory
- Set up basic agent class structure with proper docstrings
- Implement configuration handling for the agent

### 2. Core Functionality
- Implement step execution logic using `@function_tool` decorator
- Create functions for each step in the workflow
- Ensure proper input/output handling between steps
- Implement in-memory state management for partial results

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Create `test_deterministic_agent.py` in `/tests` directory
- Implement unit tests for:
  * Step execution order
  * Partial result propagation
  * Error handling scenarios
  * Input validation
- Set up test fixtures and mocks as needed

### 4. API Integration
- Create FastAPI endpoint in `/app/routers`
- Implement input validation at the API level
- Add proper error handling and response formatting
- Ensure API key verification is in place

### 5. Documentation
- Update implementation progress
- Document API endpoints
- Add usage examples
- Document testing procedures

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**
- Agent successfully executes multi-step workflows
- Steps are executed in the correct order
- Partial results are properly managed
- Error handling works as expected

2. **Testing**
- All unit tests pass
- Edge cases are covered
- Integration tests confirm API functionality
- Test coverage meets target metrics

3. **Code Quality**
- Follows project coding standards
- Properly documented with docstrings
- Modular and maintainable design
- Secure implementation (no sensitive data exposure)

## Dependencies

- OpenAI Agents SDK
- FastAPI framework
- Testing libraries (pytest)
- Environment configuration

## Timeline

1. Basic Structure Setup: 1 day
2. Core Functionality: 2-3 days
3. Testing Infrastructure: 2 days
4. API Integration: 1 day
5. Documentation: 1 day

Total Estimated Time: 7-8 days

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**
- Complex step ordering logic: Mitigate by careful design and thorough testing
- State management issues: Use isolated in-memory structures
- API integration challenges: Follow FastAPI best practices

2. **Testing Risks**
- Test coverage gaps: Implement comprehensive test suite
- Integration test complexity: Use proper mocking and test isolation

3. **Security Risks**
- API key exposure: Use environment variables
- Input validation: Implement thorough validation at all levels

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1:
1. Review and refine implementation
2. Gather feedback from team
3. Begin planning Phase 2 (Handoff Agent)
4. Document lessons learned and best practices
