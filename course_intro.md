## Course Structure and Modules

This course is organized as a monorepo containing clearly defined modules. Each module incrementally builds on previous knowledge:

### Completed Modules:

- **Module 1: Hello World Agent**  
  *Skills:* FastAPI basics, OpenAI SDK, environment setup, testing.  
  *Outcome:* A functional, deployable "Hello World" AI agent.

- **Module 2: Story Telling Agent**  
  *Skills:* Deterministic and creative narrative generation, agent customization, advanced API integration, structured testing.
  *Outcome:* Three progressively sophisticated agents capable of generating detailed story outlines and full narratives.

### Upcoming Modules:

- **Module 3: Basic OpenAI Agents**  
  - Streaming responses, dynamic system prompts, lifecycle management.

- **Module 4: Custom LLM Providers**  
  - Integration of external large language model providers.

- **Module 5: Supabase Integration**  
  - State management and logging with Supabase.

- **Module 6: OpenAI Agent Tools**  
  - File search, web search integration.

- **Module 7: Agent Handoffs**  
  - Seamless task delegation between agents.

- **Module 8: Agent Patterns**  
  - Agents as tools, routing, parallelization, and guardrails.

- **Module 9: Research Agent**  
  - Multi-agent workflows, information retrieval, structured research reports.

- **Advanced Modules:**  
  - Agent swarms, dynamic agents, reflection agents, chain-of-thought processes, and more.
