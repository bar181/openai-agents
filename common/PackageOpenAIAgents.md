## 1. Deterministic Flows

**Description:**

Deterministic flows break down complex tasks into a sequence of predefined sub-steps.  The agent executes these steps in a fixed order, ensuring that the output of each step becomes the input for the next. This pattern is ideal for tasks requiring a specific, predictable execution path (e.g., outline → story → ending).

**Example Code:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def generate_outline(text: str) -> str:
    """Simulate generating an outline."""
    return "Outline: A brief outline of the story."

@function_tool
def generate_story(outline: str) -> str:
    """Simulate generating a story based on the outline."""
    return "Story: A complete narrative derived from the outline."

@function_tool
def generate_ending(story: str) -> str:
    """Simulate generating a story ending."""
    return "Ending: A satisfying conclusion to the story."

deterministic_agent = Agent(
    name="DeterministicAgent",
    instructions="Execute a multi-step story generation task.",
    tools=[generate_outline, generate_story, generate_ending]
)

async def run_deterministic_agent(user_input: str) -> str:
    result = await Runner.run(deterministic_agent, user_input)
    return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."
```

**Explanation:**

*   We define three functions (`generate_outline`, `generate_story`, `generate_ending`) decorated with `@function_tool`.  These represent the sub-steps.
*   The `DeterministicAgent` is configured with instructions and these tools.  The agent's internal logic will call these tools in the order they appear (or based on its instructions and LLM reasoning). *Important:* The order of tools in the `tools` list *does not* strictly guarantee execution order. The agent's instructions and the LLM's reasoning determine the actual call order.  To *force* a specific order, you would need to structure the agent's instructions very carefully or implement custom logic within a single `function_tool`.
*   `Runner.run()` executes the agent.

## 2. Handoffs & Routing

**Description:**

Handoffs enable an agent to delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents.  A "triage" or "routing" agent examines the user's input and, based on predefined criteria (e.g., language, request type), transfers control to the appropriate sub-agent.  The `handoff()` function facilitates these transitions.

**Example Code:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, handoff

# Define specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="SpanishAgent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish."
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="EnglishAgent",
    instructions="You only speak English."
)

# Main triage agent that uses handoffs
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="TriageAgent",
    instructions="Route to the correct agent based on language.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, handoff(english_agent)]  # handoff() is optional here
)

async def run_routing_agent(user_input: str) -> str:
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, user_input)
    return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."
```

**Explanation:**

*   We create two specialized agents: `SpanishAgent` and `EnglishAgent`.
*   The `TriageAgent` is configured with a list of `handoffs`.  In this simple case, we can directly include the agents in the `handoffs` list.  The `handoff()` function is optional here, but it becomes crucial for more complex scenarios (e.g., specifying `input_type`, `on_handoff` callbacks).
*   The `TriageAgent`'s instructions guide it to select the appropriate sub-agent based on the input.
*   `Runner.run()` handles the execution and the handoff process.

## 3. In-Memory Conversation State

**Description:**

While the Agents SDK is primarily designed for stateless interactions between runs, it's possible to maintain an in-memory conversation state *within a single run*.  This is achieved by passing context variables or using ephemeral data structures (like dictionaries) to store and retrieve partial results or conversation history between sub-steps or sub-agent calls.

**Example (Conceptual - Pseudocode):**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

# ... agent definition ...

async def run_agent_with_context(agent, user_input: str) -> str:
    context = {"user_id": "12345", "conversation_history": []}
    result = await Runner.run(agent, user_input, context=context)

    # The agent can update or read from the 'context' dictionary as needed.
    # For example:
    # context["conversation_history"].append(user_input)
    # context["conversation_history"].append(result.final_output)

    return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."

```

**Explanation:**

*   A `context` dictionary is created to hold relevant data.
*   This `context` is passed to `Runner.run()`.
*   The agent (and any sub-agents or tools it calls) can access and modify this `context`.  This allows for passing information between steps.
*   *Important:* This context is only valid for the duration of a single `Runner.run()` call.  It does *not* persist across multiple runs of the agent.

## 4. Function Calling and Tools

**Description:**

Agents can be extended with custom functionality by defining and calling external Python functions.  The `@function_tool` decorator transforms a regular Python function into a tool that the agent can use. This allows integration with external APIs, databases, or any other custom logic.

**Example Code:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Example: Return weather data (in practice, integrate with an external API)."""
    # In a real implementation, you would call a weather API here.
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

weather_agent = Agent(
    name="WeatherAgent",
    instructions="You can retrieve weather information.",
    tools=[get_weather]
)

async def run_weather_agent(city: str) -> str:
    result = await Runner.run(weather_agent, city)
    return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."
```

**Explanation:**

*   The `get_weather` function is decorated with `@function_tool`.
*   The `WeatherAgent` is configured to use this tool.
*   When the agent's instructions and the LLM's reasoning determine that the `get_weather` tool is needed, it will be called with the appropriate arguments.
*   The tool's return value is then used by the agent.

## 5. Runner and Execution

**Description:**

The `Runner` class is the core component that manages the execution of agents.  It provides methods for running agents synchronously, asynchronously, and with streaming output.  The agent loop continues until the agent produces a final output (no more pending tool calls or handoffs).

**Key Methods:**

*   `Runner.run(agent, input, context=None)`: Asynchronous execution. Returns a `RunResult` object.
*   `Runner.run_sync(agent, input, context=None)`: Synchronous wrapper around `Runner.run()`.
*   `Runner.run_streamed(agent, input, context=None)`: Enables streaming output from the agent (not covered in detail here, as it's more relevant for future modules).

**Example Code:**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

# ... agent definition ...

async def run_agent(agent, input_text: str) -> str:
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input_text)
    return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."
```

## 6. Tracing & Debugging

**Description:**

Tracing provides detailed insights into the agent's execution flow.  It captures events like LLM generations, tool calls, handoffs, and more.  This information is invaluable for debugging and understanding the agent's behavior, especially in complex multi-step or multi-agent scenarios.  Custom trace processors can be used to log, analyze, or visualize these events.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Traces:** Represent the overall execution of an agent.
*   **Spans:** Represent individual events within a trace (e.g., a single LLM call, a tool call).
*   **Trace Processors:**  Classes that implement methods like `on_trace_start`, `on_trace_end`, `on_span_start`, `on_span_end` to handle trace events.

**Example (Conceptual - Pseudocode):**

```python
from agents import trace, Agent, Runner

# ... agent definition ...

with trace("Agent Execution Trace"):  # Use a context manager for tracing
    result = await Runner.run(agent, "some input")
    print(result.final_output)

#  In a real-world scenario, you would define a custom TraceProcessor
#  to handle the trace events and log them or send them to a monitoring system.
```

## 7. Exception Handling

**Description:**

The Agents SDK defines several custom exceptions to handle various error conditions that might occur during agent execution.  Proper exception handling is crucial for robust agent workflows, particularly in multi-step processes where errors in one step could affect subsequent steps.

**Key Exceptions:**

```markdown
*   `MaxTurnsExceeded`: Raised when the agent exceeds the maximum allowed number of turns (iterations) in its loop.
*   `ModelBehaviorError`:  Indicates an unexpected behavior from the underlying language model.
*   `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`:  Raised if an input guardrail is triggered (more relevant when using guardrails, which are covered in later modules).

**Example (Conceptual):**

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, MaxTurnsExceeded

# ... agent definition ...

async def run_agent_with_error_handling(agent, input_text: str) -> str:
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(agent, input_text)
        return result.final_output if result else "Error: No response."
    except MaxTurnsExceeded:
        return "Agent did not complete within the maximum allowed turns."
    except ModelBehaviorError as e:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"
    # Add more except blocks as needed for other specific exceptions.
```

---

## 8. Model Settings & Configuration

**Description:**

The behavior of agents can be fine-tuned by adjusting the underlying language model's settings.  Parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` control the randomness and creativity of the model's responses. These settings can be specified when creating an agent or overridden during runtime.

**Key Parameters:**

*   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output.  Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make the output more random, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more focused and deterministic.
*   `top_p`:  An alternative to temperature, called nucleus sampling.  It considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `top_p`.  Lower values (e.g., 0.5) lead to more focused output.

**Example:**

```python
from agents import Agent, ModelSettings

# Define custom model settings
settings = ModelSettings(temperature=0.5, top_p=0.9)

# Create an agent with these settings
agent = Agent(
    name="CustomAgent",
    instructions="Perform a specific task.",
    model_settings=settings
)

# Alternatively, you can override settings during runtime:
# result = await Runner.run(agent, input_text, model_settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.2))
```

## 9. Extensions & Advanced Topics

**Description:**

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides several advanced features for building more complex and robust agent systems. These include:

*   **Orchestrating Multiple Agents:** Combining deterministic steps with handoffs, and potentially even more complex interactions between multiple agents.
*   **Guardrails:**  Implementing safety mechanisms to prevent the agent from generating harmful or undesirable outputs (covered in later modules).
*   **Extensions:**  Using features like handoff filters (to control which agents can be handed off to) and dynamic instructions (to modify the agent's instructions during runtime).
* **RunItem and HandoffInputData**: These data structures define the format for passing messages, tool call outputs, and handoff requests.

**Note:** Detailed coverage of these advanced topics is beyond the scope of this Module 2 document, but it's important to be aware of their existence for future development.
